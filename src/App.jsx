//  The routing setup
/*
- This "createBrowserRouter" function creates a router using the browser's history API. It enables navigation between routes without full-page reloads.
- It takes an array of route objects that define the paths, associated components, loaders, and actions.


Top-Level Route
{
  element: <AppLayout />,
  errorElement: <Error />,
  children: [ ... ]
}
-- <AppLayout /> - Acts as a layout structure for the app
-- <Error /> - If any error occurs at this level(at that route) (e.g., during navigation or data fetching failure), the Error component is rendered
-- loader: A function that fetches or prepares data before rendering the component meaning, it is executed before rendering the component. This ensures the component has necessary data on initial load. The data returned by the loader is passed to the component via the useLoaderData hook
-- action: A function that handles mutations like form submissions or user interactions. When a form is submitted, the corresponding routeâ€™s action is called by passing in the request and params obj
